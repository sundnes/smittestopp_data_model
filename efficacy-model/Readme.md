# Readme

contacts-breakdown.csv contains the time series of contact aggregates that was used in the paper for estimating the technological tracing efficacy.
Each column shows the total number of contacts between a configuration of devices. For example, ios_ios_all column shows the total number of contacts between iOS devices per day, ios_ios_asymmetric shows the number of contacts between iOS devices that were only reported by one device and ios_ios_symmetric shows the contacts that were reported by both devices.

The data in contacts-breakdown.csv can be used to reproduce the top left panel in figure 2 in the main text. Please refer to the methods for the equations needed for reproducing the figure.
